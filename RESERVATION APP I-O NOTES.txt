PHONE-SIDE INFORMATION:

(User-provided)

{ 
	NET ID, PASSWORD

	START TIME, END TIME, ROOM #, TITLE, DESCRIPTION
		(invitees)
}

This is probably all mapped to a reservation # or a NET ID or something like that

SERVER-SIDE INFORMATION:

{
	AVAILABLE TIMES (checked out, busy, restricted, checked out by user)
	RESERVATION REFERENCE #
	USER'S RESERVATIONS
}


So, in addition to making reservations, we should be able to EDIT and DELETE them.
